# CMAN_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT -- amount of time to wait to join a cluster
#     before giving up.  If CMAN_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT is positive, then we will
#     wait CMAN_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT seconds before giving up and failing if
#     we can't join a cluster.  If CMAN_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT is zero, then we
#     will wait indefinitely for a cluster join.  If CMAN_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT is
#     negative, do not check to see if we have joined a cluster.
#CMAN_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT=60

# CMAN_QUORUM_TIMEOUT -- amount of time to wait for a quorate cluster on
#     startup. Quorum is needed by many other applications, so we may as
#     well wait here.  If CMAN_QUORUM_TIMEOUT is zero, quorum will
#     be ignored.
#CMAN_QUORUM_TIMEOUT=45
CMAN_QUORUM_TIMEOUT=0

# CMAN_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT -- amount of time to wait for cman to become a
#     cluster member before calling 'cman_tool' leave during shutdown.
#     The default is 60 seconds
#CMAN_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=60

# CMAN_NOTIFYD_START - control the startup behaviour for cmannotifyd,
# the variable can take 3 values:
# yes                   | will always start cmannotifyd
# no                    | will never start cmannotifyd
# conditional (default) | will start cmannotifyd only if scriptlets
#                         are found in /etc/cluster/cman-notify.d
#CMAN_NOTIFYD_START=conditional

# CMAN_SSHD_START -- control sshd startup behaviour,
# the variable can take 2 values:
# yes                   | cman will start sshd as early as possible
# no (default)          | cman will not start sshd
#CMAN_SSHD_START=no

# DLM_CONTROLD_OPTS -- allow extra options to be passed to dlm_controld daemon.
#DLM_CONTROLD_OPTS=""

# Allow tuning of DLM kernel config.
# do NOT change unless instructed to do so.
#DLM_LKBTBL_SIZE=""
#DLM_RSBTBL_SIZE=""
#DLM_DIRTBL_SIZE=""
#DLM_TCP_PORT=""

# FENCE_JOIN_TIMEOUT -- seconds to wait for fence domain join to
#     complete.  If the join hasn't completed in this time, fence_tool join
#     exits with an error, and this script exits with an error.  To wait
#     indefinitely set the value to -1.
#FENCE_JOIN_TIMEOUT=20

# FENCED_MEMBER_DELAY -- amount of time to delay fence_tool join to allow
#     all nodes in cluster.conf to become cluster members.  In seconds.
#FENCED_MEMBER_DELAY=45

# FENCE_JOIN -- boolean value used to control whether or not this node
#     should join the fence domain. If FENCE_JOIN is set to "no", then
#     the script will not attempt to the fence domain. If FENCE_JOIN is
#     set to "yes", then the script will attempt to join the fence domain.
#     If FENCE_JOIN is set to any other value, the default behavior is
#     to join the fence domain (equivalent to "yes").
#     When setting FENCE_JOIN to "no", it is important to also set
#     DLM_CONTROLD_OPTS="-f0" (at least) for correct operation.
#     Please note that clusters without fencing are not 
#     supported by Red Hat except for MRG installations.
#FENCE_JOIN="yes"

# FENCED_OPTS -- allow extra options to be passed to fence daemon.
#FENCED_OPTS=""

# NETWORK_BRIDGE_SCRIPT -- script to use for xen network bridging.
#     This script must exist in the /etc/xen/scripts directory.
#     The default script is "network-bridge".
#NETWORK_BRIDGE_SCRIPT="network-bridge"

# CLUSTERNAME -- override clustername as specified in cluster.conf
#CLUSTERNAME=""

# NODENAME -- specify the nodename of this node. Default autodetected.
#NODENAME=""

# CONFIG_LOADER -- select default config parser.
# This can be:
# xmlconfig       - read directly from cluster.conf and use ricci as default
#                   config propagation method. (default)
#CONFIG_LOADER=xmlconfig

# CONFIG_VALIDATION -- select default config validation behaviour.
# This can be:
# FAIL - Use a very strict checking. The config will not be loaded if there
#        are any kind of warnings/errors
# WARN - Same as FAIL, but will allow the config to load (this is temporarily
#        the default behaviour)
# NONE - Disable config validation. Highly discouraged
#CONFIG_VALIDATION=WARN

# CMAN_LEAVE_OPTS -- allows extra options to be passed to cman_tool when leave
#     operation is performed.
#CMAN_LEAVE_OPTS=""

# INITLOGLEVEL -- select how verbose the init script should be.
# Possible values:
# quiet           - only one line notification for start/stop operations
# terse (default) - show only required activity
# full            - show everything
#INITLOGLEVEL=terse
